        <p class="text-xl mb-12">Bring CalorieBot to your server and instantly provide a fully managed fitness and weight-loss experience – like adding a private gym, personal trainer, and nutritionist to your community overnight.</p>

        <div class="bg-secondary rounded-lg p-8 mb-12">
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">No longer just a place to hang out or play games, your Discord becomes a high-value wellness hub that members are eager to pay for.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">With CalorieBot, you can charge a recurring monthly membership fee (typically $20−$50 per user) for access to this premium experience. Unlike other platforms or private Discords that charge far more for less, CalorieBot delivers unmatched quality and functionality, allowing you to price based on your personal brand's goodwill and the exclusive value of your server's "digital gym."</p>

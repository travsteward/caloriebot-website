    content: "CalorieBot is pretty amazing and I've been using it -along with the methods- I've learned from other users to keep my body fat in a stable 10-11% range. I've been able to do this while holding good muscle mass and enjoying my meals a lot too. I've found one of the best uses for the photo bot calorie counting feature is when eating away from home. Snapping a photo is super easy and then I can run them instantly for tracking or upload later. I like the CalorieBot channels for the various eating styles too. That way I can focus on discussing or sharing with people most aligned with my style.",

    content: "This tool / platform is incredible. Makes it so easy to stay on course with calories with next to zero effort. Take a photo, add details and it fully breaks down your meal... THEN it tells you how many calories you have left in the day to hit your goal. I have more momentum in my health and body composition goals than I ever have after a month and it's because of how easy it is to tracking calories... FINALLY. It's a true gamechanger and something I will probably use forever - it's that good.",

    content: "The photo analyzer makes eating to a calorie deficit so easy. I've just been uploading all the photos at the end of the day and then adjusting my calorie intake the following day if I go over, which means I dont have to punish myself for one bad eating day. Including calorie counting in to my eating habits has been made simple and I highly recommend CalorieBot.",
